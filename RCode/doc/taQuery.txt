This function allows raw query execution on the database into R.

API: taQuery(query: Character)

It will return a matrix with the data in string representation

Example:
a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taQuery(a, "SELECT Pos, neg, wcnt, Pos - neg FROM slst")
print(mat)

Now Say we want to order the results to find the most negative sentence.
We also want to sort by word count if two sentences have equal negativity.

mat <- mat[with(mat, order(-Neg, wcnt)), ]
print(mat)
