This returns a data.frame containing all of the sentiment data collected
by the analysis sorted by section. Sentiment is determined using the 
inquierer lexicon, and is stored as a double value. Here it is 
returned as sentiment per word count in each section.


API: taSectionSentiment(context, sec:list())

If sec is non-empty, you can filter which sections appear.

Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taSectionSentiment(a, TRUE)

Now let's see how well virtue, vice and positivity correlate

# show correlation matrix
cor(mat[c("Pos", "Virtue", "Vice")])
