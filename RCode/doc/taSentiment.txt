This returns a data.frame containing all of the sentiment data collected
by the analysis. Sentiment is determined using the inquierer lexicon, and
is stored as a double value. Here it is returned as sentiment per word count.

API: taSentiment(context, bySentence: Boolean, sec:list())

bySentiment controls whether the matrix should only include agregated sections
or should dump data on individual sentences.

You can limit the sections shown by setting sec to a non-empty list of
sections ids. 

Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taSentiment(a, TRUE)

Now let's see how well virtue, vice and positivity correlate

# show correlation matrix
cor(mat[c("Pos", "Virtue", "Vice")])
