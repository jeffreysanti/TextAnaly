This returns a data.frame containing a list of all instances
where a particular relation exists between two entities

You can specify lists of entities as well, but you then
lose the ability to control which are compared against
which others [all combinations tested]

The results are sorted by their appearance in the text.
You can limit which sections are scanned.

Because entities are sometimes multiple words, you may have to
include wildcard operators '%' before and/or after your search
terms. This may include entities you did not intend.

For convience, the number of rows is printed out after executing
in case you are storing it to a data.frame.


API: taRelations(context, words1:list, words2:list, sections=list())

NOTE: neither words lists can be an empty list
To see a list of related words, see taRelationsSummary()

Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taRelations(a, "it", "fall")
