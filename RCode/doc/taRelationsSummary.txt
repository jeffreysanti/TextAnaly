This returns a data.frame containing all known relations
to the specified entities


API: taRelationsSummary(context, words:list, sections=list())

NOTE: words cannot be an empty list

Because entities are sometimes multiple words, you may have to
include wildcard operators '%' before and/or after your search
terms. This may include entities you did not intend.

For convience, the number of rows is printed out after executing
in case you are storing it to a data.frame.

The count for each type of relation will be totaled for all
occurances in all sections. If you want to see how many per
section see taRelations

You can limit the search to specific sections as well.


Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taRelationsSummary(a, c("liberty", "%freedom%"))
