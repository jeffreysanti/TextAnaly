This returns a data.frame containing each sentence where one/all of a
set of words is used.

If containsAll is TRUE, only sentences containing each listed word
is returned. By default FALSE, any one of the words will trigger
a match.

Section IDs can also be filtered.

API: taLocateWordUsage(context, words: vector, secs, containsAll=FALSE)

Example:

a <- taLoad("multi.db")
mat <- taLocateWordUsage(a, c("summer", "lights", "signs"))
