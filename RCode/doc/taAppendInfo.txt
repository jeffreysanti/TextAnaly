This returns a data frame with an additional column.
The column added is determined by the param value.

Below is a list of possible param values:

* lexdens [LexicalDensity]
* gfog [GunningFogIndex]
* flki [FleschKincaidGradeLevel]



Note: To work as intended each param value has required
columns. If an invalid param value was given, an error will be
printed in addition to the original dataframe being returned.

Each Paramater has a helper function as well:
for instance taAppendLexicalDensity(mat) is equivilant to:
taAppendInfo(mat, "lexdens")

API: taAppendInfo(context, param: text)


Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
mat <- taAllSentences(a)
mat <- taAppendInfo(mat, "lexdens")
