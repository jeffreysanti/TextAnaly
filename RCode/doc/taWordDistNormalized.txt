This returns a data.frame containing the usage ratio of the
given words (agregate ammount) appearing in each section.

If aggregate is TRUE, count data will be based on cummulative 
totals, otherwise it will be the count in that section.

API: taWordDistNormalized(context, words: vector, aggregate=FALSE)

Example:

a <- taLoad("multi.db")
mat <- taWordDistNormalized(a, c("summer", "lights", "signs"))
