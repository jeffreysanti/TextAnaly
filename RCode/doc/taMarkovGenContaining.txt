Generates sentences using markov chains which
contain a specified word.

Note: This is done by randomly generating
sentences until one contains the word you
request. If a word is never found it will loop
for at most timeout iterations before giving up;
therefore, there may not be count sentences
returned. This is to prevent infinite loops.

count is the number of sentences to generate

API: taMarkovGenContaining(mcontext, word, count=1, timeout=500)

Example:

a <- taLoad("heights_sm.db")
m <- taMarkov(a)
taMarkovGenContaining(m, "grass", 10)
