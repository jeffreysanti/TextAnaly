@@@MONTH,AUGUST@@@
I was in shock this morning as I woke with haste after only a short rest. I felt unusally aware of things happening around me, which made my shower rather enjoying, but it's disappointing that I have to spend the rest of my day driving my siblings around and then working. ^^^MAINPOINT^^^  Ok, I'm done being a morning person, I want to go back to bed.
