Wow, after looking at last nights post I must have been in a really bad mood. Oh well, Moore deserves it, but I'm not in a political mood right now. Today I got the chance to sleep in, which was very enjoyable. After some regular internet stuff (news, email, etc) I got back to my java book, which is fairly interesting. I'm learning about the basics of internet connection through java, and I have to admit that it seems a lot easier that I would have thought.     I think that once I get through this book I'll begin with a calender sort of program. None of the extra stuff, just what I need, and then I'll try and extend it with internet access so I can look at my calender from any computer. That seems like a reasonable project idea, which brings me to my next thought.    Since I started learning java there has been one thing that really bugs me. Everything that I need for more my computer is in one way or another already made, and for that matter made much better than I'll be able to anytime in the next few years. My calender idea I like because I'm yet to find a nice calender app that I'm willing to use. Another project I might do sometime is to help out my dad's small business with writting a database application to manage all their customers and what not, but it will be a while before I'm capable of that level of coding. Maybe next summer.
