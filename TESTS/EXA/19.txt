What is work? This is how I described it today:     Work is when old people steal 6.2% of you paycheck, 9.06% is taken to fund criminals (aka, politicians), and 1.45% keeps you from sueing your boss (healthcare). That's work. Oh, and don't forget that 7% of what you have after that goes to those criminals again.   Yea, that's work.
