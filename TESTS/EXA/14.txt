If google is able to get amazing programmers like Bloch ( urlLink link ) then I don't think it will be long until they will be able to start picking off programmers from Microsoft, which in my opinion would be very cool since they are the backbone of Microsoft. I think the time has come that microsoft back off some. Microsoft played a vital role in setting standards for the computer world, but now they are getting too powerful. Along with GNU/Linux becoming easier to use all the time, it might not be too long until Windows is replaced as the leading os.    That will be cool.
