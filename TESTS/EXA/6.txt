Wow, summer vacation has never been so busy. I've been working tons and have been home almost no time the last few days. I decided tonight to spend some time at Matt's house for lack of much anything better to do. The internet had been broken on his mom's computer for a while, but it's finally fixed, the solution was to install XP pro (the guy who fixed it is a relative of Matt's and apparently works with computers). He also got Firefox working, but is yet to discover themes or extensions, apparently he is afraid that they could damage the computer. Oh well.  On the first morning of having my cell phone (I guess thursday) I tryed to set a PIN to keep people from screwing with my phone, but ended up sending my phone into lockdown. Luckly it was easy just to call the service provider and get it fixed. Definatly worried me at first though.  Hmm, time to explore this computer and see how much I could fix it.... To bad Matt thinks I'll crash it (obviously he has never seen my computer which run's super fast and smooth.
