@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
Like the rest of the world, living in my house is living in the middle of many problems. I could tell many stories, and maybe someday I will, but here is todays.    Knowing that today is my day off from work, (being the only day that the store is closed) I decided that when my dad said he would be doing paperwork I would help him some. I had no clue what I was getting myself into. After we finished the normal stuff, my dad went on to describe some problems that had been around for a while that were affecting the cash registers that we use in our stores. So, me being the most technical person in the house, I was nominated to spend about three or four hours trying to replicate the problem in a controlled enviroment so that it would possible to pinpoint the error and pass the information to the programmer and have him fix it. ###FUNNY### So I found at least one problem, and I have to say, that programmer was not the brightest guy. I mean the code for this must be really poorly written so that when you tell it not to ring up and order, it adds it to the day's records anyways.  ###/FUNNY###  I think I'll go back to reading about java now.
