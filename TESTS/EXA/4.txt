@@@TOPIC,FAMILY@@@
I wish my family would tell me what's happening. My mom came by my room around 11:15 pm last night and told me I should go to bed. This surprised me because usually they don't mind how late I stay up. Naturally I asked if I had to get up the next morning, to which I got the response that I was going to Kings Island (a roller coaster / theme park) in the morning with the rest of my family. ^^^MAINPOINT^^^ I wish they could at least tell me when I'll be spending a whole day away from the house 'cause some of us (me) have friends and occasionally do things with those friends. The weird part is that my mom (aka, boss) already talked to a manager so that she could fill in for me, but I never even heard about that from work.  Oh well, breakfast time.  urlLink  Some old school fun.
