It's amazing what music can do to somebody. I use to never listen to music, until I discovered ocremix.com which I now listen to for a few hours everyday. I don't know what it is, but there is something about music, any music, that takes the stress away. Even Rammstein can relax me when I'm in a bad mood. Admitedly, I don't like rap, but when I actually listen to it (which there isn't much to listen to) it's nice just to hear the (minimal) music involved.  ^^^MAINPOINT^^^   It's fun to watch myself change over the years.
