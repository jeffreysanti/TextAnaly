Recently I've given up drinking caffenine filled goodies (Mountain Dew and Coke-Cola) for multiple reasons,  but mainly just to be healthy. After having been addicted on and off for 3 years, this is tough. I always feel like falling asleep, even while standing, and I'm tempted to just move my cup 3 inches from the sprite do the coke on the fountain drink machine. Oh well, it shouldn't be to bad.
