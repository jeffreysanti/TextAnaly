@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
I've noticed that over the last year I have become increasingly interested in politics. The main reason for my interest is the fact that in 6 months I'll be 18 and they'll have that much more control over my life, but also I have started working this summer and when somebody takes 15% of my paycheck I start to wonder what's happening with it.    So, to skip the fluff, I'm conservative on most issues, but I also have strong libertarian side. To get into the details would take me hours of writting and fill many pages, which quite frankly, I don't feel like doing. However, what sparked me today was Bill O'Reilly's interview with Michael Moore. After seeing that debate I felt so sick that any person could be so stupid. Harsh to say, but honestly, if he can make at least $10 million for himself off of one movie, he has to be more intelligent than he appeared. For example, he asked O'Reilly if he would give his child's life for the war. O'Reilly said he would give his own, but refused to say he would give his child's. Thank god, that stupid fat guy thinks that parents actually just put their kids in boxes and send them off to war. As of yet, there is no draft, and every person in the military is there by choice. (and for those who say they are there for the college, then you can blaim the democrates for them being their since Ted Kennady is so proud of democates introducing the GI Bill)     I'd like to see Moore put his life on the line for his country, or even just say he would.    Update: Look at Moore's webpage, he has to tell his readers to put on protective goggles when watching O'Reilly's interview because you know, they might actually see some truth for once.
