@@@MONTH,AUGUST@@@
Today I noticed something interesting. I've actually spent enough time driving around with my arm out my window, which are open since I have no ac in my car, that my left arm is signifcantly more tanned that my right. Girls at work think I should at least put that artifical tan stuff on my right arm to balance it all out, but I think it's to much fun. ###FUNNY### Like when I get back to school:  Friend: "What did you do this summer" Me: (holds up arms next to each other) "Left-Arm-Tanning" Friend: "wtf?" Me: "Lots of time in my car." Friend: "ohh...."  So it's not the world's best plan, but it will give me a good laugh.
