@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
Last night I decided that for the first time in two week I was going to go visit Matt, since I'm usually there about twice a week. Night started off fairly boring, but then we found some C rocket engines. Sadly, we had no launch device so we tried to build our own. First we made small fires but they never got close enough to the rocket, so then we moved on to candles, but it was then that we learned you needed more than a small fire to light it. Matt then came up with the idea that we should use some gasoline, which we decided would probably work. We then went on a hunt to find some, and then Matt poured it on to the rocket, and while I wasn't watching he started making a line so that we could light that. It was my plan just to throw some burning paper at it and let it take over from there, but Matt really wanted to light it on that line, so he took the burning paper and started waving it around the ground to find that line again, and suddenly it all went up in flames. Looked cool, probably not the best idea. However, much to our disappointment the rocket refused to light, so we put out the fire and played video games.     Next morning: Usually in the morning I'm the first awake, and Matt usually sleeps until I leave, but today he was up first. So to get he revenge on me for previous attempts to wake him, he did as I once had and used the WetJet Swiffer to spray that soapy stuff all over my face, which instantly woke me up, but I kept still and made sure my mouth was shut. I then waited until he was close enough (I could hear him moving) and grabbed him and tried to get a headlock, which didn't work perfectly, but better then most tries. Matt then realized that I'm not a nice person to wake up.     Finally, I got home an hour later and I have to say that I really like being home. Everything is clean, no pets, I have a computer that actually works, and I have my music.
