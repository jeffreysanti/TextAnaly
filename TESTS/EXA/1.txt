       Tonight was interesting. I decided to play monopoly with my siblings, but my brother being the crybaby he is stopped within 20 minutes. However, after that the game kept going. Againt my two sisters (15 and 11) it was obvious that my 11 year old sister would lose, which she did because of her stratagy to collect the railroads and utilites. At the end she was kinda depressed, but took it better than my brother. Then it came down to just me and my sister (15) and it seemed like she would win since she much better property and more money, but by pure luck I started missing all her property and she hit my land. Then when it was obvious that I had won we kept on playing for another 30 minutes or so while nothing happened, and finally I beat her with some bad luck on her side. ^^^MAINPOINT^^^ Total game time was 3.5 hours, and the most interesting part was that for the first time when I played a board game with my family, I really didn't care that I won.  It's bed time.
