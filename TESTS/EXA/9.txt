I know why I'm posting to this blog. I have a need, a desire, to focus my life on what is important to me and prepare myself mentally and physically for the next few years. ^^^MAINPOINT^^^ By putting my thoughts into words, telling the internet my plans, and posting my achivements I can study myself, and watch what happens to me, and change myself. I will change myself, and I hope this can help.
