@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
I wish somebody around my house who knows how to cook would. I haven't had real food at home for 2 weeks. So today I finally started to crack, and I needed something to eat at 9:30 pm. Then I got an idea that I could go to McDonald's and get Sundays for my family (we have coupons) and then buy a burger for myself. Brilliant I thought, despite it being nasty food, its my best chance. So off I went to McD's, and go figure, I meet somebody who honestly surprises that anybody would hire this person. We got past the four Sundays real easy, but then the fun started:  Me: "... and a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwich, not a meal." McD: (searches cash register for that button) " uhh, what number is that?" Me: "It's a three, but I only want the sandwich." McD: "Ok." (presses button)  So then I notice that the price is for that of the single, not the double. Arg.  Me: "Is that the double or just the single?" McD: (Turns around and ask the manager in spanish is it's correct, corrects to the right sandwich)  Wow, and I thought I had it tough with the people I work with.  Hey, at the sandwich tasted ok and I'm still alive.
