@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
I envy those who instantly know early in high school what they are good at, what they can show off. I think about what I like and what I do everyday, yet I don't know. I can't figure it out. I try different hobbies, and I try them again. I read about what others do, and I search for something I can do. To be honest, nothing is really fun to me. I don't like video games or tv, I'm yet to find a sport I like (except casual dodgeball in phys ed, and no, I havn't seen the movie) . For now all I have is my computer and the internet, which I explore so much of, yet I'm still a stranger to almost all of the web. I'll just have to keep hunting.    I have to say, following the white rabbit just ain't that easy.
