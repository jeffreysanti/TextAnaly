@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
Isn't summer supposed to be all relaxing and nice for k-12 students? It's definitely not like that for me. Besides working 20+ hour weeks, I get stuck with studying for school, which isn't all that bad since it is programming, but I also have to do some reading and service hours for school. I also have the joy of driving my four younger siblings all around town to help them keep their lives nice and busy. Today was the first day in two weeks that I've seen my girlfriend, or any of my friends for that matter.     I need a vacation.
