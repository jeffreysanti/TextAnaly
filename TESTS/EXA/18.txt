So I took two IQ test earlier today and scored 147 on the first ( urlLink link ) and 133 on the second ( urlLink link ). The second IQ test also rated me as a numerical logician. Here's what they have to say about that:   Numerical Logicans have very strong spatial abilities and can easily understand things on a complex, abstract level.   Then they told me that only 6 in 1000 people are of that type. Cool is what your supposed to think, I'm special, but being a number person I did the quick math. First off, they choose what type of thinker you are by your top three of eight sections. Then it's easy to use combinations and find that there are 56 diffent types, and 1000/56 is ~18. From that it's easy to believe that my number is below average since not many people like math.    It took somebody with a PhD to come up with that little idea, and my high school mind was able to destroy its purpose. I think I'll let my ego run free at work today.
