@@@MONTH,AUGUST@@@
Against my will I recieved my own cell phone today. First off, why would I not want one? My answer is that I don't want to become addicted to talking so much, nor do I want to spend the money. Luckly, the second problem is solved by my parents who bought it because they feel that it unsafe for me to go driving without some form of communication available. Also, being the lucky kid that I am, I got to learn to work the phone, which just happens to be the same model as my mom's and sister's. So then I had to enter the phone book for my mom, sister and myself. After that, I feel really sorry for George Jetson, he has it really tough.
