Yea, I'm a geek. Computers are my hobby. I think it's vital that people understand at least the basics of computers simply because of their importance in our everyday lives. ###PROG### For a couple years I programmed in basic for my TI-83 calculator, and I was able to create some interesting programs that pushed the language. However, that made me realize that I needed to move on to bigger and better areas. I studied Z80 Assembly for a while on my own, and even wrote a simple program on my own, but I realized that even with the power of assembly the calculator was a far to limited platform. ###/PROG### I was determined that I would learn to program for computers. Which language, and how I didn't know, but I would. So I looked into my high school's Computer Science Department (actually it's math department, they only have 2 cs classes) and talked to the teacher of computer science. I learned that they used java, so I set out to learn it, and even better, I was able to convince my dad to buy me "Big Java" which has helped make learning java on my own so far much easier. Now I've managed to learn everything I need to know to get into AP CS, and a bit more. To all non-programmers, you should try it, if at least only to understand a bit more about what keeps society as it is today.
