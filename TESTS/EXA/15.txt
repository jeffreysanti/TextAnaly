@@@MONTH,JULY@@@
I spent some serious time today updating, installing, and cleaning my computer. I started off by completly portioning all my bookmarks into folders (my favorites file in firefox is over 50kb of xml goodness) and then I completly uninstalled and reinstalled my firefox extensions (they had been giving me some problems since I reinstalled a few days ago with firefox crashed on me). After my fun doing all this and playing with some of the new extensions (One really nice one, Tabbrowser Preferences 0.6.5, has made surfing much cleaner), I had to go to work, which, like always, was really boring. However, I decided it's time to get an rss reader and play with the idea, so I got feedreader which is looking nice so far. Sadly, my dad's making go to bed now 'cause I have to wake up tomorrow to go report my discovers on the cash register to my uncle who works for my dad.
